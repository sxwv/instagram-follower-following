## Here's how to check who follows you and who doesn't.

- Open **F12**
- Click on **Console**.
- Type **allow pasting** to allow pasting of commands.
- Enter the command line and change the topic. **example_username** Make it your Instagram name.
- Press Enter and wait until the topic **{PeopleDontFollowBack}** appears, then press the arrow keys.
- There will be two topics that will come up:
**PeopleIDontFollowBack**
and
**PeopleNotFollowingMeBack**

## Try not to check too often or too frequently or you may get your account suspended.
